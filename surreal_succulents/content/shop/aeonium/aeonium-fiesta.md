description = "Aeonium 'Fiesta' is one of the most outstanding variegated cultivars in the Aeonium world. The variegation is spectacular, changing colour throughout the growing season. Each rosette can grow up to 8'' in diameter and looks beautiful potted up on its own as a feature plant.\n\nAs the succulent grows it tends to branch, to encourage more branches pot on during the spring by lowering the main growing stem into the succulent compost to encourage new roots to feed the plant.\n\nWhen growing the variegated varieties it is advised to protect them from direct sunlight. We recommend to position them under other plants such as palms or taller Aeoniums. You can also place them in a position where they get morning or afternoon sun. A perfect succulent for a semi-shady balcony or patio."
