Aeoniums come from the Canary Islands, Madeira and the Eastern coast of Africa. Aeoniums can vary in size, colours and form, from branching to monocarpic and clumping varieties. Aeoniums are so fantastically architecturally diverse in their growth formations. We have many different species available but continue to update our collection with an extensive range of hybrids, cultivars and our own in-house Surreal Succulents
