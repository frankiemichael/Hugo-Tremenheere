description = "Aeonium 'Halloween' is a brilliant hybrid of unusual colouring.\n\nThis fantastic plant is unusual due to the leaf markings and colours being so different from others, ranging from green, red and yellow. In strong light, the red line down the centre of each leaf is very distinctive. Additionally to it being unique, is the shape of the rosette. It may look like Aeonium 'Blushing Beauty' but it is a very common offsetter that keeps its branches close to create a very structural formation. Not only that, under strong light, the rosettes curl upwards and create a rose-bud shape. It is a truly extraordinary plant.\n\nThis plant deserves its own large pot to grow into and show off. It would fit perfectly on a porch or open windowsill."
