 \nIt quickly became one of the most sought-after Echeveria's around and became incredibly popular in Asia, with the price for just one plant costing well over �300.
 \n
 \nThey are notoriously slow to offset but easily one of the most beautiful and rewarding Echeveria's around, the most attractive feature has to be their pale green-grey leaves set off by their almost black outer leaf margins.
 \n
 \nThey are stunningly beautiful and structural succulents that rarely encounter any problems with pests or diseases.
 \n
 \nThey make fantastic houseplants as they are so robust and easy to care for, just place them in a bright/sunny windowsill and water when the soil dries, feed with a slow-release feed in the spring. They love our summers so growing them outdoors in a pot or in the garden in full sun will show off their full potential an intensify the dark outer leaf margins.
 \n
 \nIf kept�dry outside during the winter they are hardy down to -7.

 \nEcheveria agavoides 'Ebony' was originally�found growing in Mexico by John Trager and Myron Kimnach, it was released in cultivation�in the year 2000.
 \n
 \nIt quickly became one of the most sought-after Echeveria's around and became incredibly popular in Asia, with the price for just one plant costing well over �300.
 \n
 \nThey are notoriously slow to offset but easily one of the most beautiful and rewarding Echeveria's around, the most attractive feature has to be their pale green-grey leaves set off by their almost black outer leaf margins.
 \n
 \nThey are stunningly beautiful and structural succulents that rarely encounter any problems with pests or diseases.
 \n
 \nThey make fantastic houseplants as they are so robust and easy to care for, just place them in a bright/sunny windowsill and water when the soil dries, feed with a slow-release feed in the spring. They love our summers so growing them outdoors in a pot or in the garden in full sun will show off their full potential an intensify the dark outer leaf margins.
 \n
 \nIf kept�dry outside during the winter they are hardy down to -7.

50352,,x Semponium 'Sienna',"Available in 2021 during the week of the prestigious Chelsea flower show.
 \n
 \nIntroducing the outstandingly beautiful�intergeneric hybrid��Semponium �Sienna�, worlds first official cross between Sempervivum and Aeonium.
 \n
 \nIn a quest to produce hardier succulents for the UK�climate, we have raised a new hybrid between�Sempervivum �Green ice� (raised by Howard Wills and�registered 2006, of unknown parentage) and Aeonium��Ice Warrior� (Aeonium smithii � Aeonium �Cyclops�) Surreal Succulents cultivar.�Using these two plants as the parents should�potentially produce a hardier, more robust and�beautiful succulent as sempervivums are known to be�particularly hardy.
 \n
 \nThe parents are both members of the Crassulaceae�family. However, their flowering seasons are very far�apart, with aeoniums generally flowering in the spring,�and sempervivums flowering from summer to�autumn. That was the real challenge in creating this�hybrid, not to mention the fact that Aeonium flower�very sporadically, so it was incredibly unpredictable.�We were lucky enough to have one of our Aeoniums�start to flower in late summer so we were able to use�fresh pollen from it to cross it with the flowering�Sempervivum �Green Ice�, which in due course�produced seed.
 \n
 \nWe were amazed when we had successfully germinated�the seeds, and we were astonished once we began to see�the first batch of seedlings growing in the seed tray.
 \n
 \n�Semponium �Sienna�
 \n
 \nParentage: Aeonium �Ice Warrior� (m) � Sempervivum��Green Ice� (f).�Etymology: �Semponium �Sienna� is named after Mark�s�first-ever child and daughter who is now 1 year�old.�This brand new hybrid �Semponium �Sienna� is a�prolific grower with a large central rosette which�produces multiple offsets. The leaves are slender with�the outer part of the foliage becoming more spoon-shaped. The colouring is the most exciting part of the�plant with its unusual sienna colour, and its bright red�leaf margins. These plants are now undergoing�hardiness testing to see if they are as hardy as their�Sempervivum parent. The eventual size is 30cm high�and 30cm across.
 \n
 \nWe where due to release�this plant for�the first time at the RHS�Chelsea Flower Show 2020.�We had also entered it�into the Chelsea Plant�of the Year competition�at this show.
 \n

56593,,x Graptoveria 'Nyla',"World�s first exclusive.
 \nx Graptoveria �Nyla� is an exclusive Surreal Succulents hybrid.
 \nFinally, the day has come for the long-awaited arrival of the magical x Graptoveria �Nyla�, available here for the first time in the world.
 \nThe first time we ever showed this amazing plant was at the RHS Malvern Spring Show back in 2018, even back then we didn�t offer any to sell because we were showing the only ones on the planet at that point, since then we have managed to produce some more offsets but this plant has been incredibly slow to produce them.
 \n
 \nThe original mother plant came from a seed batch back in 2014 and out of the hundreds of seeds that came up Nyla was the only seedling of this colour, the rest of the seeds were blue, from the same seed batch we also got x Graptoveria �Supernova�.
 \nOver the years we have noticed that not all offsets have this amazing pink colouring in-fact they revert into a blue form which is easier and quicker to grow which we offer online because the offsets sometimes revert we have come to the conclusion that the plant must be an incredibly rare mutant form, much like a variegated plant but this one somehow turned out into this unbelievable pink specimen.
 \nTo get the amazing intense pink colouring, grow x Graptoveria �Nyla� in the morning or late afternoon sun during the summer, as we have noticed strong intense light can affect and wash out the colours.
 \n
 \nThe plant in the image is the one you will receive; it�s growing well in a 9cm pot and measures approx. 6cm across and 4cm high.
